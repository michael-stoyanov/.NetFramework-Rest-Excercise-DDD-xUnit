#  Pariplay Football League Assignment
	
				### TODOs:
1. Write the proper documentation for controllers and services.
2. Hide database exceptions with generix ones to hide valuabe information/table names for attackers
3. Reflection automapper profiles.
4. Implement logging.
5. ~~CORS~~
6. Add team relationship with Team score table and refactor rankings controller around it.
7. Add validations and exceptions in Rankings controller/service/repo.
8. Static file which has all of the string messages for logging and exceptions.

------------------

				### Maybes:
1. Create custom exceptions with own exception messages.
2. Fix exceptions filter response status code.

------------------

		### If I had more time: 
1. Unit and integration tests - **In Process**
	
------------------

				### Notes:
Haven't tested everything. I tested Team and Game controller at one point but they were refactored 
(because when i'm devoted to something i constantly think of other or better ways to make them, 
nothing is concrete most of the times) and didn't had the time to fully test everything properly.
	
Swagger UI is implemented and set as default starting page of the project that's why i didn't send 
a Postman collection and i assume it will be faster for testing this way.
